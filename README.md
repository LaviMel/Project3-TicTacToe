## 100 Days of Code: Project 3 - Tic-Tac-Toe (Scripting)
This is my third project in the "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp" course. This project was a fun challenge where I had to think carefully about the game logic and build up the user experience using the Python console. It was a great opportunity to sharpen my scripting skills!
